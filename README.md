# L-System
This is an L-System framework easily extendable through custom rule sets.
The default ruleset is A becomes AB, and B becomes A. Future plans for this project are mapping letters to instructions via an 'interperater'.
Rulesets are stored in Hashtables, allowing for easy creation of custom rule sets.
